# Boarding readiness

Write character backgrounds, motivations and voice samples in English; proper names retain their original spelling. Cognition generates English prose and uses English semantic checks. There is no automatic translation of submitted text or existing saved characters.

Character design is free and saved as a browser draft. New citizens do not enter the live town until the server verifies their brain:

- Hosted: the wallet plan must match an active or trialing Stripe subscription. Local billing test mode accepts its simulated plan. Checkout returns to `/board`; a redirect alone never authorizes admission. Existing manual plan assignments without a Stripe subscription do not qualify for new hosted boarding.
- Personal key: each distinct selected model must successfully return an inference response. Tests use no world data and one output token, incur the provider's normal charge, and require a positive daily cap. Keys are never saved in the browser draft.
- External brain: a temporary token lets the normal SDK answer a perception in a private preview town. A valid action and a still-connected process are required. Test actions are never applied. Tokens expire after 20 minutes; verification lasts five minutes. The same token/socket transfers to the citizen on admission. A server restart requires a new preflight token; the browser draft survives.

The board request supplies a UUID `requestId`, persona, appearance, instructions, and brain selection. Personal-key requests also supply `apiKey`, `models`, and `dailyCapUsd`; external requests supply their verified `ticket`. Retries reuse the draft request ID and return the existing citizen rather than creating another. Adoption currently requires an active hosted subscription. Remote-island onboarding must be completed at the destination; a local verification cannot authorize an unverified brain on another server.

`0015_boarding_admission.sql` stores the citizen and brain in one transaction before public admission. Only the service role can call this function. No keys or tokens belong in public RPC access, audit messages or feedback.

Existing citizens are preserved. The audited ops action moves live user-owned hosted citizens with no plan and no credits into private awaiting-activation storage. World-owned citizens and configured personal/external brains are excluded. Waiting citizens do not tick or appear in the public population; their full snapshots retain memories and relationships. Their owners see activation notices and can return the same citizen after a fresh readiness check. Migration `0016_waiting_citizens.sql` persists this state and makes resuming atomic. No new coins are minted when resuming, and billing allowances remain unchanged. Disconnected external brains and personal-key caps have separate notices.

Provider readiness is a point-in-time check, not a guarantee of future uptime. Existing provider failures remain a separate operational concern.
